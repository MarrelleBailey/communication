# Solid World Strategy 

This is a document detailing the Solid World webinar strategy including elements such as a record of the Solid World template agenda and a place to co-create suggestions on how to improve Solid World as well as a record of ideas for future editions. 

Solid World is a webinar held on the first Thursday of every month. Up to date information about Solid World, including the agenda for the next edition and recordings of past additions, is published on [this page](https://solidproject.org/events). 

## Solid World Agenda Template

* Introductory Welcome by Mitzi as host and Solid Manager (5-10 minutes)
* Talks 
* Panel discussion with Q&A with audience and speakers 
* This Month in Solid update by Mitzi 
* Specification progress updates from the Editors (usually Sarven) 
* Thoughts from TimBL as Solid Director
* Wrap up by Mitzi 
* 30 minute open conversations between audience

# Themes
If we’re thinking about a “multi-episode arc” to Solid World over time, we can try to build each month’s presentations around one of these vertical themes:
* Finance 
* Health 
* Media 
* Travel
