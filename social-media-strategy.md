| ------------- | ------------- |------------- |
| #SolidProject  | 13  |  |
| #TheSolidWorld  | 14  | none, untouched |
| #SolidLive | 10 |------------- |

### Tweet Content 

### Five Days before Solid World
* Including the mentions of speakers, graphics and link for the event (rough example below)
* countdown graphics 

### During Solid World 
During the event have premade tweets scheduled to release (we can post every 15 minutes or discuss how active we want is best) 
* Asking the speakers the main points for their talk
* Quoting the speakers
* Sharing otherâ€™s tweets

### How to Tweet
It is best to designate one person to live-tweet on behalf of Solid. The more people the more cluttered and disorganised it gets.
